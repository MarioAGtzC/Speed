1. Develop code as per requirement

As a backend programmer I have already collaborated on three projects already delivered and one in process which is in production

2. Developing research skills - exhaust all documentation material (internal or external) to reach a solution

Ask the senior developers for help and code review as well as using the tools given by TCS and the SDK documentation for AWS

3. Adherence to internal TCS/client specified processes/systems thereby providing zero defect delivery

I stick to the schedule generated thanks to my manager who knows all the procedures and sends the necessary emails to proceed in a correct way with the development process

4. Use of proper naming conventions as well as proper file and folder structure for code

I have use the proper naming for lambdas, dynamodb tables, API Gateway, and S3 folder structure for faster flow at development time as well as improving this with CloudFormation service

5. Documentation and repository committal



6. Defect containment effectiveness - Code check review and unit testing fully functional

Test individually every lambda with the test tool and cloudwatch as well as integration testing between lambdas, dynamodb and S3 for correct operation and with my frontend partner to properly display the data to the user

7. Debugging Effectiveness, include all possibilities to reduce risks

Effective code debugging for backend with the tools given by AWS and the use of the developer tools given by browsers for frontend

8. TCS Mandatory course compliance

To this day I'm compliant

9. Timesheet compliance

To this day I'm compliant

10. Meeting Attendance

I have complied with my attendance to the meetings until today

11. Continuous learning and initiative to explore new methodologies

As a new technology for me I started to learn AWS technologies and an extensive learning of javascript
