1. Develop code as per requirement

As a backend programmer I have already collaborated on two projects already delivered and one in process

2. Use of proper naming conventions as well as proper file and folder structure for code

I have use the proper naming for lambdas and S3 folder structure for faster flow at development time

3. Develop high-quality code and solutions

I have developed code that is easy to understand and that fulfills its purpose

4. Requirements gathering /capturing within defined timeline - SLA

For the first two projects I wasn't able to participate on requirements definition but I did participate in their progress. For my actual project I did participate in several meetings for the correct use of the customer apis

5. Developing research skills - exhaust all documentation material (internal or external) to reach a solution

Ask the senior developers for help and code review as well as using the tools given by TCS and the SDK documentation for AWS

6. Adherence to internal TCS/client specified processes/systems thereby providing zero defect delivery

I stick to the schedule generated thanks to my manager who knows all the procedures and sends the necessary emails to proceed in a correct way with the development process

7. Sustainable adaptability for climate change of project

Thanks to the serverless nature of AWS it is not necessary to improve the performance of a server, as for the code, I try to maintain a quality so that it can be updated or improved in the future without problems

8. Familiarity with current system topography and team responsibilities

I'm well aware of the senior developers and managers to who i can approach for questions or issues

9. Effective problem solving and soft skills with fellow developers

All the implementation and development in the projects that I have participated have been in conjunction with my development team as well as daily meetings

10. Ownership of project requirements and progress

All functional requirements have been met based on project expectations otherwise it would not be considered a successful product

11. Closure of post implementation defects raised by customer within prescribed SLA

Thanks to the schedule generated with the help of our manager, it is possible to finish the project as soon as possible in order to deliver a project at the agreed acceptance level

12. Defect containment effectiveness - Code check review and unit testing fully functional for POC/DEMO/UAT/DEV/PROD

Test individually every lambda with the test tool and cloudwatch as well as integration testing between lambdas, dynamodb and S3 for correct operation

13. Debugging Effectiveness, take ownership of code enhancements when developing, fixing or improving code - Applied code continuity

Effective code debugging for backend with the tools given by AWS and the use of the developer tools given by browsers for frontend

14. TCS Mandatory course compliance

To this day I'm compliant

15. Timesheet compliance

To this day I'm compliant

16. Meeting Attendance

I have complied with my attendance to the meetings until today

17. Continuous learning and initiative to explore new technologies

As a new technology for me I started to learn AWS technologies and an extensive learning of javascript
