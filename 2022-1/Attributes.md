1. Makes systematic and rational judgments based on relevant information, and supports the same with facts. Identifies potential issues/opportunities in complex situations and foresees implications of proposed solutions.

I think my approach to the backend allows me to judge based on customer needs in order to develop an acceptable solution especially in a product as variable as user360

2. Listens effectively and expresses ideas in a clear, concise and organized manner. Pays attention to verbal/non-verbal cues and adapts accordingly. Conveys the desired information and influences others towards required action through verbal or written means.

I continue to constantly work on my communication and thanks to my past actions I am able to better communicate my ideas for necessary solutions, as well as help my colleagues in their projects with the extra time I got.

3. Continuously seeks knowledge to enhance one's professional growth and performance. Makes use of opportunities for learning that the job as well as the organization provides. Learns new technologies, tools and processes relevant to one's job.

I have been taking more advanced courses as well as learning about growing technologies

4. Takes action to meet work-related objectives without being asked or required to do so. Seeks out and willingly undertakes new challenges, responsibilities/assignments. Volunteers ideas for improvement and readiness to spearhead its implementation.

I always try to complete my tasks ahead of time so that I can deliver the product ahead of time and have time to continue learning

5. Provides an original solution by using various tools and techniques and constantly questioning the status quo. Experiments with new approaches and effectively utilizes creativity to enhance outcomes.

This is something that happens a lot in a user360 since customers have different ideas or problems to solve we have to develop new solutions as well as prepare them for future implementations

6. Creates an environment of trust and cooperation through an open exchange of ideas towards achieving team goals. Works effectively in group settings and collaborates with teams.

Thanks to the daily meetings, it has been easier for me to get to know better with my coworkers to work collaboratively, exchange ideas and offer myself as a help in some of their activities

7. Makes decisions and takes action which is consistent with the company's core values and with the principles enshrined in our code of conduct. In the pursuit of results, acts with a high degree of integrity and responsibility

I consider that so far all my actions have been based on the ideology of TCS maintaining an environment of trust and taking into account the code of conduct of this same
